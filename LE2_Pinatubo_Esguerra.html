<h1>How I Met Your Father Will Have Some Similarities and a Possible Connection to HIMYM</h1>
<img src="https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/how-i-met-your-father-barney.jpg?w=620" alt="barney" class="responsive">
	<p>With the announcement of the TV comedy series How I Met Your Father (HIMYF) came the inevitable question: how closely will this new series starring Hilary Duff be tied to the megahit sitcom 
	How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM)? Fans of the original TV series can give themselves a legendary high five, 
	because HIMYF may have some sort of connection to HIMYM.In HIMYF, Sophie (Duff) will narrate the story of how she met her son's father - similar to how Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) explains to his kids how he met their mother. 
	In the original series, Bob Saget narrates the story as an older Ted reminiscing on his younger days, however it's uncertain if HIMYF will have another actress providing the voiceover for an older Sophie. The similarities don't stop there,
	because HIMYF will also follow a group of New York City friends navigating the dating world, their careers, and friendships. <a href= "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/met-father-similarities-possible-connection-192149593.html">Read More</a> </p>

	<h1>‘The Sopranos’ Stars Claim HBO Paid James Gandolfini $3 Million Not to Star in ‘The Office’</h1>
	<img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sopranos-office.png?resize=800,465" alt="tony" class="responsive">
	<p>The most recent episode of the “Talking Sopranos” podcast finds hosts and “The Sopranos” actors Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa dropping a bombshell on guest Ricky Gervais. 
	According to the actors behind Christopher Moltisanti and Bobby Baccalieri, HBO paid “Sopranos” lead star James Gandolfini a whopping $3 million not to appear on NBC’s sitcom “The Office.” 
	The series was the U.S. remake of Gervais’ BBC comedy of the same name. “You know, they talked about having Gandolfini at one point replace him,” Gandolfini told Gervais (via Insider). “Did you know that?”
	added, “I think before James Spader and after [Steve] Carell, they offered [Gandolfini], I want to say, $4 million to play him for the season — and HBO paid him $3 million not to do it. 
	That’s a fact.” <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/07/james-gandolfini-rejected-the-office-hbo-1234651311/">Read More</a></p>

	<h3>Why Chris Pratt Didn't Help Promote Parks And Recreation's Mouse Rat Album</h3>
	<p class="mn">Before Chris Pratt was listening to mixtapes while guarding the galaxy in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he was playing in a band while slacking off as Andy in the popular comedy Parks and Recreation. Earlier this year, it was announced that the show’s band, Mouse Rat, was getting an actual album release that includes all the favorites from the series. Although Pratt’s character was the band’s frontman, he was absent from any promotion for the 16-track The Awesome Album. 
	Now the actor is speaking out about why he didn’t help promote his former faux band’s real life album. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/why-chris-pratt-didnt-help-promote-parks-and-recreations-mouse-rat-album">Read More</a></p>
